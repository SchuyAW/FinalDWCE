                                The Council has manipulated and misrepresented the consultation process throughout to
                                suppress any negative feedback from residents and to represent a level of support for
                                their plan that simply isn't there. These plans are the council's, not ours. Their
                                “consultation” was them informing us what they intend to do to us and telling us it's
                                what we asked for.

                                If you read the publicity put out by the council, they regularly include the phrase
                                “co-production”. Involved residents who attempted to have some meaningful influence over
                                their plans challenged the council again and again to stop using the phrase
                                “co-production” as it was untrue. Eventually, there was an admission that residents did
                                not co-produce but in fact “influenced” the council's decisions. Though in their
                                planning application, they again claim we co-produced with them.
                            </p>

                                The evidence is that the only influence we may have had was over things like water taps
                                and art not substantial matters like the scale of the development or retaining community
                                land and facilities. LBHF Council are not the first to use deceptive consultations to
                                appear to be co-producing when they are not.<a

                                development but instead wanted a very, very large one that would fill the entire centre
                                of the Estate and take four years of demolition and re-development.
