                                The Council has manipulated and misrepresented the consultation process throughout to
                                suppress any negative feedback from residents and to represent a level of support for
                                their plan that simply isn't there. These plans are the council's, not ours. Their
                                “consultation” was them informing us what they intend to do to us and telling us it's
                                what we asked for.

                                If you read the publicity put out by the council, they regularly include the phrase
                                “co-production”. Involved residents who attempted to have some meaningful influence over
                                their plans challenged the council again and again to stop using the phrase
                                “co-production” as it was untrue. Eventually, there was an admission that residents did
                                not co-produce but in fact “influenced” the council's decisions. Though in their
                                planning application, they again claim we co-produced with them.

                                The evidence is that the only influence we may have had was over things like water taps
                                and art, not substantial matters like the scale of the development or retaining
                                community land and facilities...

                                from the developer consultations, but, like all the other requests for documents, they
                                sent no evidence to support their claims.

                                About the council's consultation, residents stated that even though they raised
                                objections and concerns to the council and its consultants, they were ignored. They had
                                a sense that consultation was and remains meaningless as the council will go ahead
                                regardless of residents' views...

                                Over the coming weeks, we will set out how the council has set the worst example for
                                developers in the borough who may wish to ride roughshod over the wishes of the

                                We begin with the question of how an officer told the council that the council's White
                                City Estate residents had told the council officers that they did not want a small
                                development but instead wanted a very, very large one that would fill the entire centre
                                of the Estate and take four years of demolition and re-development...

                                The Council set up an “Advisory Panel” that it had total control over. They stated that
                                this group would just advise the council about how to conduct early engagement with
                                residents until the Defend Council Homes Policy, which was in development, was
