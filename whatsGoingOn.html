                            overall loss of about 2,000 sq meters. Our open central area will then be filled with 5 and
                            6 storey buildings increasing the estate population significantly and leaving us with no
                            significant area of the estate that is not built up.

                            They began the deception in 2019. A Ward Councillor and council officer attended a meeting
                            of the White City Residents' Association (WCRA) to inform the community that the council had
                            a pot of money for housing development (around £15m) that it wanted to use to build new
                            council housing within White City Estate. We were told it would create 100% council
                            tenancies and could be erectecd on one of a number of small sites within the center of the
                            estate. (There was no mention of taking the whole of the center of the estate and building
                            hundreds of homes, most of which would not be for social housing tenants). They said the council
                            would let Council Residents on the Estate decide exactly where and how extensive the
                            development would be and would not proceed at all if we did not approve of any of the
                            options.

                            the end of RIBA stage 3 (planning permission), despite no discussions yet with the
                            community. Nor did we know that this was part of a wider strategy to begin taking
                            non-residential assets (Community Land and Facilities) to build on. The information about
                            their strategy is contained in a number of documents but a good deal can be found in the
                            papers presented to the LBHF Cabinet meeting in July 2019 (<a

                            response to these drivers of change, officers have commenced a high-level review of
                            opportunities in the Council’s Housing Revenue Account (HRA) and General Fund land and
                            property holdings to understand the size of the Council’s opportunity. This work has focused
                            on non-residential assets, only considering the potential to renew the Council’s dwelling
                            assets where there has been existing engagement with the community and there is a clear
                            appetite from residents who will be impacted.”

                            when it came to major decisions, but made them feel that they had some input.

                            In July 2021, a Council officer reported to LBHF that they had conducted a consultation,
                            despite the Covid Lock-downs in 2020/21. During this Lock-down consultation, he said that
                            residents had told the council that they did not support a small re-development, but the
                            “majority attending the consultation” supported re-development of the whole of the center of
                            the estate. Given that there were no gatherings allowed for most of this period, it is no
                            surprise that we can find only one meeting attended by residents at which the scale of the
                            re-development was discussed. There were less than 5 social housing Tenants of White City Estate in
                            attendance, they had none of the information required to make a decision, they were not
                            empowered to make any decisions and they say that they did NOT approve of a major
                            re-development. Even if they had, it would clearly be wrong. There was NO Ballot, NO Vote of
                            any description offered to all Estate Residents.

                            full control of so that they can suppress any negative feedback and only report positive
                            things. Attempts by the Residents' Association members to get the information to assess the

                            ignored or obstructed. Even a Freedom of Information request was rejected.
