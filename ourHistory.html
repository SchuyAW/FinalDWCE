                        Nearly 100 years ago there was an appreciation of the needs of people living in densely
                        populated Estates such as White City. The central area of the estate has been a community
                        provision since the estate was built and previous council administrations respected the
                        residents enough to maintain it and improve it, taking the lead from the Residents themselves.
                        Not any more. Now we have to challenge the council's plans to regain that respect. We are not
                        here to rubber stamp their plan to tear out the heart of our community.

                                    <p>
                                        White City Estate holds historical significance primarily due to its association
                                        with the 1924 British Empire Exhibition. Beyond being a temporary accommodation
                                        site for exhibition visitors, the estate's enduring impact lies in several key
                                        aspects:
                                    </p>

                                            <strong>British Empire Exhibition (1924):</strong> The estate's origin can
                                            be traced back to the grand British Empire Exhibition of 1924, a monumental
                                            event celebrating the British Empire's global influence. The White City
                                            Estate served as an essential infrastructure element, providing housing for
                                            the numerous visitors who flocked to the exhibition to witness the showcase
                                            of imperial culture and products.

                                            <strong>Architectural Innovation:</strong> White City Estate is
                                            architecturally significant, embodying the modernist design principles of
                                            the early 20th century. Characterized by clean lines and functional spaces,
                                            the estate's buildings departed from traditional styles, reflecting a
                                            broader shift in architectural sensibilities. The innovative design
                                            showcased at White City was influential in shaping future urban
                                            developments.

                                            <strong>Transformation into Social Housing:</strong> Following the
                                            conclusion of the exhibition, the estate underwent a transformation into a
                                            residential area. This shift exemplified a broader urban planning trend
                                            towards creating social housing and addressing the housing shortage
                                            prevalent in London. The estate, repurposed for the working class, became a
                                            pioneering example of how modern architecture could provide affordable,
                                            comfortable, and functional housing.

                                            <strong>Urban Design Principles:</strong> White City Estate's urban design
                                            incorporates features that prioritize community and functionality. Open
                                            spaces, green areas, and communal facilities were integrated to foster a
                                            sense of community. The layout and design aimed to create a balanced living
                                            environment, promoting well-being and social interaction among residents.

                                            <strong>Cultural and Social Legacy:</strong> Over the decades, White City
                                            Estate has been a home to diverse communities, contributing to the cultural
                                            and social tapestry of London. The estate reflects the evolving demographics
                                            and societal changes, serving as a microcosm of the city's development.

                                            <strong>Historic Milestone Approaching Centenary:</strong> As White City
                                            Estate approaches its 100th anniversary, it stands as a historic milestone
                                            in London's urban history. The estate's enduring presence not only
                                            symbolizes the city's growth and transformation but also serves as a
                                            tangible link to a bygone era.

                                    <p>
                                        The design of White City Estate is in no way accidental. The estate plan is
                                        partly influenced by Zeilenbau ideas, with blocks aligned along a north-south
                                        axis for maximum sunshine, with green spaces in between, and an east-west axis,
                                        with spaces for public buildings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the 1930s, a team from the London County Council toured Europe to find the
                                        best examples of Housing Estates that incorporated communal open spaces where
                                        private gardens would not be viable. They recognised the importance of open
                                        space for the well-being of those living in these densely populated areas. The
                                        LCC instructed their chief architect, Edwin Paul Wheeler, to incorporate several
                                        grassed areas in between blocks and a larger communal area was to be reserved in
                                        the centre of the estate for the benefit of residents. The estate was not
                                        completed on schedule and the blocks to the South West were not built until
                                        several years later.

                                        <strong>ZEILENBAU PLANNING:</strong> German cities—particularly Frankfurt and
                                        Berlin—embarked on major housing initiatives in the mid-1920s, they generally
                                        adopted bold new ideas about architecture and planning. The broader movement was
                                        encapsulated by the term Neues Bauen (“New Building”). Frankfurt, for example,
                                        has been called “one of the most remarkable city planning experiments of the
                                        twentieth century.” Between 1924-30 over 1,650,000 housing units were built in
                                        the country. Most of those housing projects—dozens of them—were built in the
                                        linear Zeilenbau pattern with a north-south row direction (or nearly so). Walter
                                        Schwagenscheidt, beginning in 1928, conducted studies to determine the
                                        “scientific optimum” orientation for the housing blocks. He called them
                                        “Comparative Sunlight Studies.” He concluded that the best orientation was to
                                        align the building with its long axis 22-½˚ west of north.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There is an overarching theme of the architecture of the 1930s: using scientific
                                        methods to shape architecture in relation to access to the sun. The larger
                                        effort to give sun-responsive architecture a basis in scientific rationality is
                                        illustrated by several research projects in the United States and England.

                                        The council sent a survey to every household to allow them to vote on changes to

                                        the BBC as compensation for their building expansion. Every resident got a vote
                                        and they chose an Over 50's Centre, Under 5s Centre, Adventure Play Centre, and
                                        Sports Hall. Empowering residents to make decisions about improvements on our
                                        estate was more inclusive and meaningful 35 years ago. We have gone a long way
                                        backwards. Now the Council makes the decisions and then pretends to involve
                                        residents.

                                    <p>
                                        In 2013, the head teacher of Randolph Beresford School and the White City
                                        Residents’ Association approached the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham to
                                        create a new pedestrian space. They recognised that the road in front of the
                                        school was unsafe and identified the need for a meeting area for residents which
                                        could also be used for small events. 3 years later, in 2016, Bridget Joyce
                                        Square was complete and this resident-led initiative is now a world-renowned,
                                        multi-award-winning open space that has become an essential part of daily life
                                        for estate residents. This project won both the ‘Added Value Through Landscape
                                        Award’ and the coveted ‘President’s Award’ at the Landscape Institute 2017
                                        awards, as well as an Institute of Civil Engineers London award and a local
                                        Hammersmith Society award, recognising the positive impact the scheme has had on
                                        the local community as well as its valuable flood mitigation and climate
                                        resilience performance. It was featured on BBC's Gardeners' World last year -
