                    Respond to the planning application by clicking the button below. Even a one-sentence objection must
                    be considered. If you have more to say, all the better. Because LBHF have refused to give White City
                    Estate Residents a vote, this is one important way that residents will be able to have their
                    opinions registered. The council claims that it can go ahead with this massive plan because we told
                    them we approve of it. But there was no vote, so if you did not say yes to this huge redevelopment
                    please register your objection to their planning application here.
                </p>
                <p>

                        insufficient open space. The development might be too high-density for the area or an
                        over-development of the estate itself. There will be loss of open space, including gardens.

                        overshadowing, especially in lower-floors.

                <p>
                    The evidence suggests that the council has not complied with several policies and legislations,
                    which could mean a Judicial Review or other court action will be viable. Those with a background in law
                    are welcome to assist in preparing legal responses.

                <p>
                    Despite years of controlled promotion by the council, the planning application remains a significant
                    opportunity for residents to exert influence through legal means. Please respond to that if you have
                    not already.
