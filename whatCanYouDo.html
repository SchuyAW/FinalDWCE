                    Estate Residents a vote, this is one important way that residents will be able to have their
                    opinions registered.

                        insufficient open space. The development might be too high-density for the area or an
                        over-development of the estate itself. There will be loss of open space, including gardens.

                        Negative/adverse visual impact of the development: Homes facing the centre of the estate will be
                        overshadowed by 6-storey blocks. Quality of life will be affected by overlooking and
                        overshadowing, especially in lower-floor blocks.

                <p>
                    The council may not have complied with several policies and legislations, which could mean a
                    Judicial Review or other court action might be viable. Those with legal expertise are welcome to
                    assist in preparing legal responses.

                <p>
                    Despite years of controlled promotion by the council, the planning application remains a significant
                    opportunity for residents to exert influence through legal means.
