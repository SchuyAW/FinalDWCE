                                We would all suffer during the demolition and construction if we allow this to proceed.
                                Those that would suffer most from this proposal will be our children. A concern that the
                                council has ignored throughout their “consultation” is the negative impact of 4 years of
                                redevelopment on children living on the estate and those attending both Randolph
                                Beresford and Saint John children's provisions. Look through the council publicity in
                                their newsletters or website and you will not find an analysis of the harms that we and
                                our children would experience. They simply don't discuss it.

                                Probably of greatest concern will be the impacts on air quality and persistent noise
                                pollution. It is critical to understand that the demolition/construction site is in the
                                heart of one of the most densely populated wards in the UK. It is bounded by hundreds of
                                homes on two sides and by two under 11's children's provisions on the other two. There
                                is no open side through which pollutants can be directed. The noise will rebound within
                                the estate. It is understood that all building work has some impact on the health and
                                well-being of those nearby. But the council decided to proceed with a four year
                                redevelopment in this location without any consideration for those who will be subject
                                to these harms and particularly our children. A smaller plan could possibly be carried
                                out without significant harm but not this proposal.

                                    Children are more vulnerable to breathing in toxins and particulates. Their airways
                                    are smaller and still developing. They breathe more rapidly than adults.

                                    Risks of poorer air quality include: their lungs not working as well as they grow
                                    older, developing asthma during childhood or as an adult - and if they have asthma
                                    already, air pollution can make it worse, wheezing, coughs, lung cancer when they’re
                                    older, infections like pneumonia.

                                    Recent studies show stronger negative mental health effects of noise in childhood
                                    and adolescents, particularly where ADHD and Autism are factors. The associations
                                    between noise sensitivity and emotions or behaviors are shown to be strongest in
                                    low-income groups. Therefore, robust strategies are required to cope with mental
                                    health problems caused by noise for children and adolescents, especially subgroups
                                    classified by noise sensitivity and lower socio-economic status.

                                Bizarrely, LBHF Council also intends to demolish Randolph Beresford Early Years Centre
                                and then move it to help with their land grab. In February this year

                                school.” Anyone who lives in White City Estate will know what a fantastic children's
                                provision, both the main site and the annex, has been for many years. Yet the council
                                tries to tell us that demolishing and rebuilding it is an improvement. They even tell us
                                we told them we want them to do it. But we didn't.

                                It was the Head Teacher at Randolph Beresford who initiated the changes to Bridget Joyce
                                Square to enhance the experience of the children on the estate and their parents. The
                                square too will be mostly lost to vehicle access and new buildings. This is what the
                                council calls “Re-imagining the square”. It is definitely NOT what was in the
                                imagination of the White City Estate community. Watch “Gardner's World” from 24 minutes
                                to be reminded why Bridget Joyce Square should NOT be re-developed.

                                ago that they will proceed with this development, they have spent the last few years
                                running down the children's provisions on the estate.

                                >. The judges concluded that “White City is one of the newer adventure playgrounds in
                                London, having evolved over recent years from a more standard childcare facility to the
                                fully-fledged, award-winning adventure playground that it is today”. Last year LBHF
                                council stripped out the equipment because it “needed maintenance”. No consultation with
                                the community, no attempt to repair or improve, no concern for the children affected.
                                The Council has now included a belated plan to confine children's play to three small
                                play areas at Mackay, Mackenzie and Havelock during the 4-year redevelopment. This would
                                not be enough. These areas are completely unsuitable to accommodate all the children and
                                parents who currently use the open spaces in the middle of the estate. The New London
                                Plan says there must be 10 sq meters of space per child on an estate.
