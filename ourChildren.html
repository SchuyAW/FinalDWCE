                            Those that will suffer most from this proposal will be our children. They have already
                            begun to pay the price. Because the council decided years ago that they will proceed
                            with this development, they have spent the last few years running down the children's
                            provisions on the estate.
                            <a href="https://londonadventureplaygrounds.org.uk/2014-white-city-crowned-london-adventure-playground-of-the-year/" target="_blank">
                                In 2014 the White City Adventure Playground won the Adventure Playground of the Year award
                            </a>. The judges concluded that “White City is one of the newer adventure playgrounds in
                            London, having evolved over recent years from a more standard childcare facility to the
                            fully-fledged, award-winning adventure playground that it is today”. Last year the council
                            stripped out the equipment because it “needed maintenance”. No consultation with the community,
                            no attempt to repair or improve, no concern for the children affected.

                        <p>
                            The Adventure Playground was more than just a place for children to play. It was a safe haven
                            and a space for creativity. Now, with the equipment removed and no immediate plans to replace
                            it, the children are left without this vital resource. The council's approach to these
                            provisions has been more about cutting costs than caring for our community's children.

                            Bizarrely LBHF Council also intends to demolish Randolph Beresford Early Years Centre and
                            then rebuild it. In February this year <a href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/20/100315" target="_blank">
                            OFSTED carried out an inspection</a> and concluded that “Randolph Beresford Early Years Centre
                            continues to be an outstanding school.” Anyone who lives in White City Estate will know what a
                            fantastic children's provision, both on the main site and in the annex, this has been for many
                            years. Yet the council tries to tell us that demolishing it is an improvement. They tell us that
                            this is what we told them we wanted. Who told them to do it? We know we didn't.

                            It was the Head Teacher at Randolph Beresford who initiated the changes to Bridget Joyce Square
                            to enhance the experience of the children on the estate and their parents. The square too will
                            be lost to vehicle access and new buildings. This is what the council calls “Re-imagining the
                            square”. It is definitely NOT what was in the imagination of the White City Estate community.

                        <p>
                            A concern that the council has almost entirely ignored throughout their “consultation” is the
                            negative impact of 4 years of building work on children living on the estate and those attending
                            both Randolph Beresford and Saint John children's provisions. Look through the council publicity
                            in their newsletters or website and you will not find an analysis of the harms that children will
                            experience. They simply won't discuss it. In the last few weeks they have included a belated plan
                            confine children's play to two small play areas at Mackay House and Havelock close. Trying to fool
                            us in to thinking that is an adequate response. It is NOT. These two areas are completely unsuitable
                            to accommodate all the children and parents who currently use the open spaces in the middle of the
                            estate. We are not Fools.

                            Probably of greatest concern will be the impacts on air quality and persistent noise pollution. It
                            is critical to understand that the demolition/construction site is in the heart of one of the most
                            densely populated wards in the UK. It is bounded by hundreds of homes on two sides and by two under
                            11's children's provisions on the other two. There is no open side through which pollutants can be
                            directed. The noise will rebound within the estate. It is understood that all building work has some
                            impact on the Health and Well-being of those nearby. But the council decided to proceed with a four
                            year re-development in this location without any consideration for those who will be subject to these
                            harms and particularly our children. A smaller plan could possibly be carried out without significant
                            harm but not this 4 year demolition and build.

                                Children are more vulnerable to breathing in toxins and particulates. Their airways are smaller
                                and still developing. They breathe more rapidly than adults.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Risks of poorer air quality include: their lungs not working as well as they grow older, developing
                                asthma during childhood or as an adult - and if they have asthma already, air pollution can make
                                it worse, wheezing, coughs, lung cancer when they’re older, infections like pneumonia.

                                Recent studies show stronger negative mental health effects of noise in childhood and adolescents,
                                particularly where ADHD and Autism are factors. The associations between noise sensitivity and
                                emotions or behaviours are shown to be strongest in low-income groups. Therefore, robust strategies
                                are required to cope with mental health problems caused by noise for children and adolescents,
                                especially subgroups classified by noise sensitivity and lower socio-economic status.

                                Considering long-term implications on behavioural problems in children and adolescents in terms of
                                their educational and professional prospects, what will be the impact on young people, particularly
                                those living closest to the demolition site and those attending Saint John and Randolph Beresford?
