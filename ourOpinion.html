                                    This website was created by residents of White City Estate to stop the Council from
                                    ripping out the heart of our estate. We are in favor of improvements and some new
                                    homes for people on the housing register. But there are ways of delivering this
                                    without taking so much from those who already have so little. This is one of the
                                    most densely populated wards in the UK, and what little we have is already not
                                    enough. Condensing the community infrastructure and open spaces and then taking the
                                    land to bring hundreds more residents to share what is left does not improve our
                                    lives.

                                    Residents have tried for the last three years to get the council to rethink its
                                    plans to demolish and rip up all the community facilities and open spaces in the
                                    center of the estate with their four-year redevelopment plan. They will not listen,
                                    so it is TIME for us to ACT. Residents elected to the White City Residents
                                    Association repeatedly tried to engage the council to discuss other options to
                                    deliver new homes that would benefit existing residents, but they would not listen.
                                    Of the £140 million that they expect to spend, none of it is earmarked for improving
                                    the homes of existing residents – it's all for their NEW residents, the vast
                                    majority of whom will have to have very high incomes to acquire a property. Their
                                    homes will have benefits that existing residents will not get.

                            The Council has a website that will tell you why everything they are doing is wonderful.
                            What you won't find there is a balanced view. You won't find information about the negative
                            impact on our health and our environment, for instance. This website was set up to give
                            residents a chance to see the other side of the story. By looking at both sites, you can get
                            a balanced view – What LBHF, the Developer, wants you to see and what DEFEND WHITE CITY
                            ESTATE, the residents want you to see. They have tried to manipulate us and misrepresent our
                            views to give the pretense that we, the residents, want them to do this to us (sometimes
                            claiming that 98% of us approve of what they want to do – a big fat LIE). BUT really they
                            know this plan is not what we want, which is why they have defied their own policies and
                            will not give us a BALLOT.

                                        At the same time that the council was reporting up to 98% support, the feedback
                                        White City Residents' Association (WCRA) received showed little support.

                                        Residents' concerns include: 4 Years of demolition and redevelopment is too
                                        long. Loss of access through the estate during works will be intolerable.
                                        Pollution (Air and Noise). No discussion of compensation for residents enduring
                                        4 years of demolition and building works. No discussion about respite or
                                        transfers for anyone with respiratory conditions or whose mental health suffers,
                                        particularly young children with asthma, ADHD or autism. Implications for
                                        increased costs to residents through bigger service charges. Height of new
                                        blocks would adversely affect view and light for some residents. RBEYC Nursery
                                        should be made bigger (using old Health Centre) not move it and make it smaller.

                                        WCRA asked for feedback from a diverse group of residents about their concerns.
                                        Like the council “consultation” not every council resident of the estate was
                                        involved. But it should be noted how different these were from the council
                                        results.

                                        cause, and the effect on peoples health and quality of life mattered to 95% of

                                        Another important matter to 86% of residents was the effect that having so many
                                        more residents would have on local services.

                                        whole of the central area of the estate being redeveloped. Nearly half of
                                        residents liked the idea of making some improvements but less than 5% liked most
                                        or all of what was being proposed by the council.

                                        71% of residents were against building 270 new homes, in particular 83% objected
                                        to the 135 private rent/sale new homes. Though there was some support for
                                        increasing the number of homes on the estate by 80 if they were Social Rent
                                        properties with 57% in favour.

                                        There was additionally concern about about filling the centre of the estate with
                                        new properties that were 5 or 6 storeys high, with 78% of residents against.

                                        The majority of residents were against making changes to Bridget Joyce Square
                                        with 75% objecting to using it for traffic in to a new development.
